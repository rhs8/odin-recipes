    <h3>For Tomato Lovers!</h3> 
    <p>A Southern classic reimagined, this irresistible Tomato Pie Dip is perfect for any occasion of the season. With layers of ripe, juicy tomatoes, fresh basil, and a creamy three-cheese spread, this crowd-pleasing dip brings all the comfort of a traditional tomato pie straight to your appetizer spread.</p>
    <p>The dip is very creamy and so flavorful with the tomatoes. Basil lightens up the palate quite a bit, and it doesn’t taste greasy,” said test kitchen cross-tester Renu Dhar. “It’s quite fun and very communal.</p>

        <li>1/2 cup chopped Vidalia onion (from 1 small [5 ounce] onion)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup loosely packed fresh basil leaves, cut into thin slices, plus more for garnish</li>
        <li>1/2 cup shredded low-mooisture part-skim mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>11/2 teaspoons hot sauce (such as Tabasco)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>crositini toast</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly coat a 10-inch skillet with cooking spray; set aside.</li>
        <li>Trim top and bottom of 1 of the tomatoes; cut into 6 (1/4-inch-thick) slices; place slices between 2 layers of paper towels; set aside. Seed and chop remaining tomatoes; place in a colander set over a medium bowl; sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon of the salt, tossing gently to distribute salt. Let stand for 10 minutes. Lightly pat tomatoes dry with a clean kitchen towel; discard liquid.</li>
        <li>While tomatoes are resting, stir together cream cheese, mayonnaise, onion, basil, mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, hot sauce, Worcestershire sauce, onion powder, black pepper, 3/4 cup of the Cheddar cheese, and remaining 3/4 teaspoon salt in a medium bowl until thoroughly combined; gently fold in chopped tomatoes until evenly distributed.</li>
        <li>Transfer tomato mixture to prepared skillet, spreading it into an even layer. Sprinkle evenly with remaining 1/4 cup Cheddar cheese and top with sliced tomatoes.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is fully melted and edges are bubbling, 25 to 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Garnish with additional basil and serve immediately with crostini.</li>
