    <img src="../img/hcm.webp"> <br>
    <h3>Mix, Roll, Bake, Eat!</h3> 
    <p>These baked harissa meatballs are a flavorful twist on a classic dish. My favorite ways to serve these are as an appetizer with a lemon yogurt dipping sauce, or in a quinoa or couscous bowl with roasted veggies.</p>
    <p>easy to make after a busy day for the family!</p>
