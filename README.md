# Recipes
This project is a basic HTML recipe website that serves as a resource for accessing various recipe pages. It uses only HTML to create a simple user interface, featuring a main heading (<h1>), section headings (<h2>), and paragraphs of content (<p>). The site includes anchor tags (<a>) with href attributes for linking to different recipes and image tags (<img>) to display images, complete with alt attributes for accessibility. To improve user experience, width and height attributes are set on images to prevent layout shifts while they load. Additionally, unordered and ordered lists are created using <ul>, <ol>, and <li> tags, making the site easy to navigate.
